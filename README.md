# motion-testing

At present, development of motion planning within Viam benefits from significant virtualized testing. Checking algorithmic performance, behavior of motion planners, forward and inverse kinematic solver performance, and tracking collision checking performance are all facilitated by the use of **scenes**. Scenes are combinations of specific robotic arms, world configurations, start and goal states, and other input parameters that comprise a repeatable test. These scenes allow the Motion Planning team to evaluate their capabilities in a more integrated fashion. 

The `motion-testing` repository also serves as the foundation for automated testing to track changes in performance that may be rooted in complex interactions. Pull requests against the `motionplan`, `referenceframe`, or `referenceframe` areas of the `rdk` repository initiate a GitHub action to execute these tests on a cloud container and post the results to the PR activity feed. This allows developers to see the impact (if any) of changes to foundational Motion or Motion-adjacent code prior to merging.

Separately, the capability exists to execute these tests on a local resource (such as a developer laptop) in the same manner as the automated CI workflow executes on cloud resources. This allows developers to evaluate performance and quality for the same scenes without needing to open an initial PR and iterate during the review process. A section below outlines how all developers can run the automated scene tests on an ad-hoc basis, compare results against each other, and generate the results table for various desired outcomes.

A comprehensive overview of the scenes (including their objectives, what features they demonstrate, and how they tie into user stories) is included below.

## Manual Execution of Tests

Note that executing these tests requires many of the same dependencies as developing against `rdk` in the first place, most notably an operational Go development environment. See the `rdk` README for details on setting up a development environment for further details.

Two possible use cases of `motion-testing` will be described in this section. First, executing a single test sequence with released `rdk` software can be done to establish baseline performance at any time. Second, comparisons of local changes and their impacts (such as those made during engineering development) can be made against the performance of unmodified code in upstream respositories. Both cases require the `motion-testing` repository to be cloned locally to continue.

### Single Benchmark

For the single benchmarking case, simply navigate to the `motion-testing` directory and execute the following commands from the head of the respository. The `$TEST_NAME` placeholder should be changed to match the desired name of the directory that will contain generated test data from this execution. You can reference individual scene executions and results by navigating to the named subdirectory in the `results` folder.

```bash
go test ./... -v -run TestDefault --name=$TEST_NAME
go test ./... -v -run TestScores --baselineDir=$TEST_NAME --modifiedDir=$TEST_NAME
cat results/motion-benchmarks.md
```

### Comparing Baseline Performance to Performance with Software Changes

In the event that comparisons between modified and unmodified code are needed, additional steps are required. This section assumes the baseline tests will be run first, followed by tests that act on modified software.

The `go.mod` file in this repository indicates a specific release version of `rdk` should be used, but a `replace` directive is commented out at the bottom of this file. Take note of this directive; we will be modifying it later.

Start by executing the first command, replacing the placeholder `$TEST_NAME` with the desired folder name; the example below will use `baseline`. If desired, the `replace` directive mentioned above can be changed to point at a local version of `rdk` (ensure you modify the path to point at the local `rdk` repository). Note that whatever code is checked out in the local `rdk` installation will be evaluated, so the `main` branch target will be the only valid options for providing "baseline" software.

```bash
go test ./... -v -run TestDefault --name=baseline
```

Once this executes and results data is in the `results/baseline` directory, you must now checkout the desired changes in your local copy of the `rdk` repository and uncomment the `replace` directive (if you haven't already). Then execute the following commands:

```bash
go test ./... -v -run TestDefault --name=modified
go test ./... -v -run TestScores --baselineDir=baseline --modifiedDir=modified
cat results/motion-benchmarks.md
```

Note the two directory arguments for `TestScores` and how these compare to the prior test commands.

By changing checked out branches in the `rdk` repository (or other repos), a developer could also benchmark multiple sets of changes against each other.

## Arm Scenes

Basic Arm Scenes 1-12 are derived from brainstorming sessions the Motion team participated in to get automated performance testing off the ground. These do not have any specific user in mind, but could be thought of as possible situations users might encounter during workspace setup or application development.

Later, named scenes represent customer-specific applications or demos that we supported or observed. By tailoring specific scenes to these applications, we should be able to anticipate impacts to certain user applications before our users make such discoveries in production.

At this time, each scene is tightly coupled to a specific robot configuration. Future expansion is planned to decouple these elements, enabling the execution of all scenes with all major robotic arm models that Viam currently supports.

## Base Scenes

Basic Base Scenes 13-18 cover a variety of situations where planning for a base on a SLAM map might be used. These scenes aren't specific to any type of base.

User scenes are not executed as part of the standard battery of tests which are evaluated during typical CI tasks. These scenes should be referenced, modified, and executed separately from any of the above **Basic Scenes**.
