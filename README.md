# motion-testing

At present, development of motion planning within Viam benefits from significant virtualized testing. Checking algorithmic performance, behavior of motion planners, forward and inverse kinematic solver performance, and tracking collision checking performance are all facilitated by the use of **scenes**. Scenes are combinations of specific robotic arms, world configurations, start and goal states, and other input parameters that comprise a repeatable test. These scenes allow the Motion Planning team to evaluate our capabilities in a more integrated fashion. Below this section, a comprehensive overview of the scenes (including their objectives, what features they demonstrate, and how they tie into user stories) is included.
